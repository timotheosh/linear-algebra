#+title: Linear Algebra

* Linear Algebra

Some exercises I have worked through in learning linear algebra using Emacs and Jupyter notebooks
** Setup
Using [[https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv][pyenv]] install an anaconda environment.
#+begin_src shell
pyenv install anaconda3-2024.02-1
#+end_src
You can get a list of availlable anaconda installations by running ~pyenv install -l~

In the root of your project you can enable your anaconda environment with ~pyenv local anaconda3-2024.02-1~ or which ever anaconda installation you go with ~pyenv local <some_anaconda_version>~. Be sure to adjust the paths in ~.dir-locals.el~ to point to your anaconda installation.

It's all maths I copied from an instructional video. So I claim no copyright, and it is unlicensed to the extent I am legally allowed to.
